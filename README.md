# Java-Chess (OLD/BAD DESIGN)
My attempt at making chess in Java with no outside help (besides references to Java swing package and to the rules of a chess game).

I wanted to try to make a chess game prior to my data structures and algorithms class to see what I can do with my current knowledge.This chess game allows players to select the pieces through the use arrow keys and the space bar. When a piece is selected, blue squares are displayed to show spaces where the piece can move while red squares are displayed for spaces that the pieces can take.

I hope to reflect on the project after my data structures class and perhaps recreate it with my new knowledge.
